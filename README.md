# Client_Server_Socket
Socket programming with Client_Server mode, this is one of the assignments I have done during my master study</br>
Simple Socket programming with socket TCP/IP mode. </br>
First is an animal guessing game with binary base serilization and another is text based Google protocal buffer.</br>
Google protocal buffer is not easy to operate with, so I did not upload the source code</br>
My main purpose is Socket commucnication and TCP/IP.</br>
Client send request to Server and so on.
